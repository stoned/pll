NAME
    pll - Create local::lib environment for Perl

SYNOPSIS
    pll [--notest] /path/to/environment

DESCRIPTION
    Pll is yet another virtualenv (<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>)
    alike tool for Perl. It is used to create isolated Perl environments
    with the help of the local::lib module
    (<http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/lib/local/lib.pm>).

    Its features are:

    *   It is a plain Bourne shell script.

    *   The created Perl environment contains the local::lib module and
        App::cpanminus' cpanm(1) script
        (<http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus/bin/cpanm>).

    *   In each Perl environment created, it installs wrapper scripts
        bin/perl, bin/perldoc, bin/cpanm so that the commands they wrap use
        the isolated Perl environment via local::lib.

    *   To ease the use of each Perl environment created, it installs the
        bin/activate.sh Bourne shell script. This script can be sourced to
        set the required environment variables. Similarly, in each Perl
        environment created, the installed bin/deactivate.sh Bourne sell
        script can be sourced to restore the environment variables set by
        the former script. Also the installed bin/pllenv script outputs how
        the required environment variables are set. See local::lib
        documentation for details.

USAGE EXAMPLES
    *   To create a new Perl environment in /tmp/p

        $ ./pll /tmp/p

    *   To install Catalyst::Devel in the /tmp/p environment just created

        $ /tmp/p/bin/cpanm Catalyst::Devel

    *   To run installed catalyst.pl script just installed

        $ /tmp/p/bin/perl /tmp/p/bin/catalyst.pl

    *   To setup the current shell session to use the environment created
        earlier

        $ . /tmp/p/bin/activate.sh $ catalyst.pl ... $ type perl perl is
        /tmp/p/bin/perl $

    *   To create a new Perl environment in /tmp/p2 with a specific Perl

        $ env PERL=/usr/local/bin/perl ./pll /tmp/p2
